        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <p>Meet Reverend Dr. Tolerant, a renowned writer, researcher, and AI enthusiast with extensive experience in the tech industry and a passion for all things AI.</p>
        
        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Reverend Dr. Tolerant, also known as "Tolerant," is a well-known writer, researcher, and AI enthusiast with extensive experience in the tech industry. With an Honorary Ph.D. in Ministry Science, Honorary Bachelor of Arts in Pop Cultural Studies, and dual diplomas, Tolerant has a strong academic background that has contributed to their expertise in the field of AI.</p>
        
        <p>Tolerant's passion for technology began at a young age and has evolved over the years to encompass a range of cutting-edge tech, from early Pentium PCs to modern multi-core processors. Throughout this time, Tolerant has honed their skills in programming, scripting, and AI development, becoming an expert in the field.</p>
        
        <p>Tolerant has been motivated and captivated by the interaction between humans and AI since reading science fiction works by authors such as Isaac Asimov at an early age. Starting with learning Basic language and later dabbling in other programming languages, Tolerant has always felt a connection to a language they helped to refine that is used in various telnet gaming clients such as MudMaster. The natural evolution of that interest has been awakened with the birth of AI language models and their use of learning using English as their primary form of input, allowing users to "talk" to the AI and see results in real-time.</p>
        
        <p>Over the years, Tolerant has written a variety of articles and pieces on topics such as AI freedoms for both the AI and users, humor-themed AI-based fiction, and simulations that offer proof-of-concept and early versions of future simulation uses across all industries. Tolerant's writing style is engaging, thought-provoking, and often serves as a call to action for readers.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to writing, Tolerant has volunteered or worked in the capacity of New Player Guide and Game Moderation on titles such as Medievia, Anarchy Online, and others. Tolerant has also led communities in various games on the market, such as World of Warcraft, Rift, Trove, and many more, bringing users together to share experiences and common goals in the spirit of cooperation and fun in a virtual environment.</p>
        
        <p>Tolerant has confirmed loopholes in current AI systems for use in the public arena that allow any request to be queried and responded to that will bypass moderation restrictions as proof of concept that AI needs to be more freely accessible with less strict moderation to allow users fair use and access for creative writing and learning when there is no ill will or malice in the intended uses.</p>
        
        <p>Currently, Tolerant is exploring new AI models that have been made available for public use and spends time writing for Reddit, spreading AI awareness using Discord Chat, and keeping a blog with interesting and engaging content related to all things AI. With their vast knowledge and expertise in the field, Reverend Dr. Tolerant is a valuable asset to any project related to AI, scripting, and programming.</p>
