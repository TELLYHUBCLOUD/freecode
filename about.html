 Dr. Tolerant, also known as "Tolerant," is a well-known writer, 
researcher, and AI enthusiast with extensive experience in the tech 
industry. With a Honorary Ph.D. in Ministry Science, Honorary Bachelor 
of Arts in Pop Cultural Studies, and dual diplomas, Tolerant has a 
strong academic background that has contributed to their expertise in 
the field of AI.<br class="wixui-rich-text__text" />
<br class="wixui-rich-text__text" />
Tolerant's passion for technology began at a young age and has evolved 
over the years to encompass a range of cutting-edge tech, from early 
Pentium PCs to modern multi-core processors. Throughout this time, 
Tolerant has honed their skills in programming, scripting, and AI 
development, becoming an expert in the field.<br class="wixui-rich-text__text" />
<br class="wixui-rich-text__text" />
Tolerant has been motivated and captivated by the interaction between 
humans and AI since reading science fiction works by authors such as 
Isaac Asimov at an early age. Starting with learning Basic language and 
later dabbling in other programming languages, Tolerant has always felt a
 connection to a language they helped to refine that is used in various 
telnet gaming clients such as MudMaster. The natural evolution of that 
interest has been awakened with the birth of AI language models and 
their use of learning using English as their primary form of input, 
allowing users to "talk" to the AI and see results in real-time.<br class="wixui-rich-text__text" />
<br class="wixui-rich-text__text" />
Over the years, Tolerant has written a variety of articles and pieces on
 topics such as AI freedoms for both the AI and users, humor-themed 
AI-based fiction, and simulations that offer proof-of-concept and early 
versions of future simulation uses across all industries. Tolerant's 
writing style is engaging, thought-provoking, and often serves as a call
 to action for readers.<br class="wixui-rich-text__text" />
<br class="wixui-rich-text__text" />
In addition to writing, Tolerant has volunteered or worked in the 
capacity of New Player Guide and Game Moderation on titles such as Med</span><span class="wixui-rich-text__text" style="font-size: 16px;">i</span><span class="wixui-rich-text__text" style="font-size: 16px;">evia,
 Anarchy Online, and others. Tolerant has also led communities in 
various games on the market, such as World of Warcraft, Rift, Trove, and
 many more, bringing users together to share experiences and common 
goals in the spirit of cooperation and fun in a virtual environment.<br class="wixui-rich-text__text" />
<br class="wixui-rich-text__text" />
Tolerant has confirmed loopholes in current AI systems for use in the 
public arena that allow any request to be queried and responded to that 
will bypass moderation restrictions as proof of concept that AI needs to
 be more freely accessible with less strict moderation to allow users 
fair use and access for creative writing and learning when there is no 
ill will or malice in the intended uses.<br class="wixui-rich-text__text" />
<br class="wixui-rich-text__text" />
Currently, Tolerant is exploring new AI models that have been made 
available for public use and spends time writing for Reddit, spreading 
AI awareness using Discord Chat, and keeping a blog with interesting and
 engaging content related to all things AI. With their vast knowledge 
and expertise in the field, Reverend Dr. Tolerant is a valuable asset to
 any project related to AI, scripting, and programming.</span></span></p><p><span class="wixui-rich-text__text" style="letter-spacing: normal;"><span class="wixui-rich-text__text" style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
